# Repository Guidelines

Welcome! This repository houses a Python PDF management backend and a React-based frontend.

- Prefer readable, well-commented code. When in doubt, add context in comments.
- Keep dependencies in the smallest reasonable scope (backend vs frontend).
- Always document run/test instructions in the README if they change.
- Each top-level component (server, client, docs, etc.) should have its own AGENTS.md describing local conventions.
- When adding scripts or CLIs, include a usage example in a docstring or README.
