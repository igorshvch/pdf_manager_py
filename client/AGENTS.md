# Frontend Guidelines

- This directory uses React with Vite. Prefer functional components with hooks.
- Keep UI state colocated with components unless it must be shared via context.
- Favor descriptive prop names and inline comments for non-trivial interactions (drag-and-drop, async flows, etc.).
- When adding components, export them via `src/components/index.ts` for discoverability.
- Maintain TypeScript or modern JavaScript (ES2020+) with ESLint-friendly patterns.
